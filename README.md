# QueryMate

QueryMate is a lightweight SQL query explorer that allows users to execute SQL-like queries on CSV data. The application is built with React and Vite, and it features an interactive UI with a Monaco Editor for editing SQL queries, smooth dark mode toggling, dynamic result tables, and CSV export functionality.

QueryMate enables users to:
- Execute SQL-like queries on CSV data.
- Edit and format queries using the Monaco Editor (with the help of `sql-formatter`).

- Toggle between light and dark modes with smooth transitions.
- Export query results as CSV files.
